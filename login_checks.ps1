<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Checks every 15 seconds for both failed (4625) and successful (4624) logon attempts 
    in the last 15 seconds, coloring success in green and fail in red (except the "no failed" message is green).

.DESCRIPTION
    - Gets both 4624 (success) and 4625 (fail) events from the Security log in the last 15 seconds
    - Uses -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue to avoid red error text if no events exist
    - Ensures we never pass null to the parsing logic (binds to empty array if no events found)
    - Prints console output in color:
        Green for successful events
        Red for failed events
        Green "No failed attempts" message if no failures found
    - Continues running until closed (or Ctrl+C)

.NOTES
    Save as "login_check.ps1"
    Run in PowerShell (Administrator).
    Adjust intervals, etc., as needed.
